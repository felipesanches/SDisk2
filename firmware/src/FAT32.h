/*
2015.07.02 by Alexandre Suaide
Added support for SDHC cards and subdirectories
Removed DSK to NIC conversion
FAT16 and FAT32 disks should have at least 64 blocks per cluster
*/

/*
2012.01.26 by Fábio Belavenuto
Added support for image exchange using a button added in the Brazilian version by Victor Trucco
Added support for a 16x2 LCD
